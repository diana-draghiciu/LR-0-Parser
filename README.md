# Implement lr(0) parser algorithm

# PART 1: Deliverables 

Class Grammar (required operations: read a grammar from file, print set of nonterminals, set of terminals, set of productions, productions for a given nonterminal, CFG check)
Input files: g1.txt (simple grammar from course/seminar), g2.txt (grammar of the minilanguage - syntax rules from Lab 1b)

# PART 2: Deliverables 

Functions corresponding to the assigned parsing strategy + appropriate tests,  as detailed below:

Recursive Descendent - functions corresponding to moves (expand, advance, momentary insuccess, back, another try, success)

LR(0) -  functions Closure, GoTo, CanonicalCollection

# PART 3: Deliverables

1. Algorithms corresponding to parsing table (if needed) and parsing strategy

2. Class ParserOutput - DS and operations corresponding to choice 2.a/2.b/2.c (Lab 5) (required operations: transform parsing tree into representation; print DS to screen and to file)

Remark: If the table contains conflicts, you will be helped to solve them. It is important to print a message containing row (symbol in LL(1), respectively state in LR(0)) and column (symbol) where the conflict appears. For LL(1), values (Î±,i) might also help.
